Welcome to IP Analyzer.
IP Analyzer is designed to assist analysts faced with IP logs that have been provided to them as a result of a production order.Welcome to teh IP Analyzer investigation tool. can save the analyst hours of effort.




Slide
A production order can result in one or more IP log files.
Each log file may contain dozens of pages and each page may contain numerous records showing communications with other IPs.
The effort to extract and analyze all of these transactions requires significant investigative resources.

Slide
It is manually intensive and requires sseveral steps to manipulate the data into the desired format.
As a result, the process lends itself to being very error prone.
Contributing to this challenge is the fact that many service providers, such as Facebook and Instagram, will provide logs in PDF format.

Slide
PDF documents are by their nature, difficult to analyze.
This format does not lend itself well to allowing the raw data to be extracted or transformed.
It can handle both ip version 4 and ip version 6 addresses.


Slide
Just click thes desktop icon to start the application.
If you have the appropriate access rights, you will be given the opportunity to choose the files of interest to you.


Slide
Simply choose one or more PDF log files for the case that you are investigating.
IP Analyzer will parse each of the files that you choose.

Slide
It will then build a summary table for each vanity name and the number of times there were communications with another IP.
For each new IP that is encountered in the log files, an internet search is conducted to get more information about that IP.

Slide
The desired data is downloaded and then stored in a central file with all other IP information, from all other production orders.
This file can be easily accessed at any time by the user and exported for use with other applications.
Subsequent IP searches check the local IP database before retrieving data from the internet.

Slide
Once all of the data has been compiled, an email is sent to the user.
If the user is on the TPS network, it will be sent to their TPS address.
Otherwise, the user will be given the opportunity to choose the email where the results can be forwarded.

Slide
The example shows an IP Analysis email that was sent to the  user's Gmail account.

Slide
The email will contain a summary table for each vanity name that was being analyzed.
It will also contain a geographical map showing the location of each of the IP addresses that were found and a table with additional information.

Slide 
an Excel spreadsheet will be included that contains the raw data and a number of Pivot tables and Pivot charts that summarize the IP activity.

This slide shows the results for one of the chosen log files.

IP Analyzer can easily be modified to enhance its capabilities to account for other log types. 
To enhance corrobration and data sharing, IP addresses can be stored in a database, used to populate a SharePoint website, or populate an analyst's notebook such as OneNote.
